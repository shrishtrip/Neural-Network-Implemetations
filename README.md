* 1D Convolutional Neural Network

## Data (except CNN)
* Data has 72 features
* Output is binary and unidimentional
* Hold-out Cross validation is used for evaluation

## Data (for CNN)
* This has the ECG data with 1000 features.
* Target field is unidimensional and binary.
* Total there are 1000 records.
* Keras is used for the implementation.
